# Paid Ads Plan — Local Search & Local Services

Objective: Capture high-intent leads in target cities with a mix of Local Services Ads (LSA) and Search Ads.

1) Local Services Ads (LSA)
- Budget: Start $50–$150/day depending on lead volume.
- Target: Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Irvine, Huntington Beach, Costa Mesa.
- Pro tip: LSA requires background checks and license verification.

2) Google Search Ads (Responsive Search Ads)
- Campaign structure:
  - Campaign per city (or city clusters)
  - Ad groups per service (EV charger, panel upgrade, lighting)
- Bids: Start conservative; optimize by CPA.

3) Sample ad copy (Newport Beach — EV charger):
- Headline A: Licensed EV Charger Installers
- Headline B: Newport Beach Electricians
- Description: Quick, professional EV charger installation. Licensed & insured. Free estimate.

4) Landing pages:
- Use city landing pages created (ensure fast load and CTA).
- Add a short form and phone link with UTM and call tracking enabled.

5) Tracking & reporting:
- Use Google Analytics + UTM parameters.
- Map calls from CallRail to UTM campaigns.

6) Budget recommendation (initial test):
- Local Services Ads: $100/day
- Search Ads: $25/day per city (target top 3 cities first)

7) KPIs to monitor:
- Cost per lead (CPL)
- Conversion rate (site form submissions + calls)
- Return on ad spend (once jobs close)
