# Call Tracking Setup (placeholder)

Goal: Capture phone call source and attribute to campaigns.

Options:
- CallRail (recommended) — easy GMB + website integration
- Twilio + custom tracking — more advanced

Quick CallRail steps:
1. Create a CallRail account and buy a local tracking number.
2. Set up a tracking number for website (use dynamic number insertion script).
3. Set up a tracking number for paid campaigns (separate number).
4. Configure call flows and record/label calls.
5. Export calls and map to UTM campaigns.

Placeholder script (replace with CallRail script when account is ready):

<!-- Insert inside <head> or before </body> -->
<script>
  // CALL-TRACKING PLACEHOLDER
  // Replace with CallRail dynamic number insertion script
  // Example: https://cdn.callrail.com/companies/XXXXX/XXXXXXXX/12/swap.js
</script>

Notes:
- If you add the real script, test dynamic number insertion on all major pages.
- Confirm that tracking numbers display correctly on mobile and desktop.
