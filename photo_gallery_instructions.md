# Photo Gallery Instructions & Filenames

Collect these photos to create a case-study gallery:
- Before/after panel upgrade (wide + close)
- EV charger install (vehicle + charger close-up)
- Interior lighting install (room-wide + detail)
- Commercial work (panels, conduit, distribution)

Image guidelines:
- Minimum size: 1600px on the long edge
- Format: JPEG or WEBP
- File naming: city_projecttype_01.webp (e.g., newport_ev_01.webp)
- Alt text: "EV charger installation in Newport Beach — JC Electric"

How to add to the site:
- Drop images into the `work_photos/` folder.
- Use the existing gallery markup (work cards) or add new items linking to case study pages.

Case study idea:
- Create 3 short case studies (250–400 words) with 3 photos each and measurable outcomes (inspection passed first try, hours saved, cost range).
