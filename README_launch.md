# Launch Checklist & Next Steps

Steps remaining while GMB verification is pending:

1. Verify Google Business Profile (monitor verification postcard/email)
2. Add Google Analytics measurement ID to `index.html` (replace G-XXXXXXX)
3. Submit sitemap in Google Search Console (Sitemap: https://jcelectric.com/sitemap.xml)
4. Claim listings using `directory_submissions.md` and record URLs in `citations.csv`
5. Purchase call tracking numbers and add dynamic number insertion script (see `call_tracking.md`)
6. Collect 6–12 high-quality job photos and upload to `work_photos/` (see `photo_gallery_instructions.md`)
7. Launch initial Local Services Ads / Search Ads once license verification is complete

Quick commands (if you manage hosting via git):

```bash
# Add and push all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare launch assets: directories, UTMs, call-tracking, ads docs"
git push origin HEAD
```

If you want, I can:
- Insert your GA measurement ID when you provide it
- Place the Search Console verification token in `index.html` (if you choose HTML verification)
- Walk you through claiming GMB and submitting the sitemap

Contact me with your GA ID or verification token and I'll finish those steps.
